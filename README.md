#Goban

I made Goban for a hackday project back in 2013 for the UF Killer App competition. I ended up getting 3rd place and $100, and it was my first experience getting paid for my skills as a software developer.

There was even a writeup about my presentation in my campus newspaper:

Please note, I wrote this before I had any real experience as a software developer, and as such the architecture of the code isn't up to the standard of what I write today. I did some basic refactoring to make the code prettier and make the project setup more logical, but I'm mostly leaving it up for historical purposes.

* Please download the project and try running it

# What does this app do?

This is a basic table-top Go board app. It's a two-player app replacement to the physical board. 
Its main features are:
- Life and death search algorithms
- The ability to undo a move
- Checks for ko
- Checks for illegal moves
- Scoring the completed game (Chinese rules)
